# AI-CALLING-VOICE-AGENT
This project is a fully open-source, cost-effective voice AI assistant designed to handle inbound phone calls using a toll-free number. It transcribes speech, understands the caller’s intent using a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM), and responds naturally using text-to-speech — all without relying on expensive APIs or cloud services.
